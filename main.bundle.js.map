She seeks the inner truth felt by all sentient beings of a given demographic, in a particular\\r\\n                    range of income, that would make the story easy to sell to the Networks.

Walter smirks at his half fish bowl and that he must be the\\r\\n            fish, “in a spaceship, spacebowl? Fishspace?” he grins. The view in this ship was superb, but Walter still didn’t like the\\r\\n            idea of leaving the cockpit.

Walter never once witnessed Dani\\r\\n            honestly seduce a man or woman. The whole thing was a calculated act that made Walter uncomfortable, but the pay was too\\r\\n            good to quit. The act, was always for the story.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “I’m not going to tell you anything about my outfit.” Bullard acts as if he were being interrogated by the enemy. Dani to\\r\\n            a lot of military personnel was the enemy. Walter felt relief that this soldier didn’t want to put a bullet in her head.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “Oh she already knows.” Walter, playing his part, says seeing right through the sultry exterior Dani had on display. He just realized she took\\r\\n            the top of her space suit off and wrapped it around her waist leaving a skimpy t-shirt on.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Bullard wasn’t fazed and Walter was getting bored with this.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “What do you mean she already knows?” Bullard turns to Walter with his rifle.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “Wait.” Walter puts up his hand.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “What is it Jelly?” Dani asks, but doesn’t want an answer, she’s already typing away.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “We survived a minute.” Walter glances at his watch.

Walter looks at the alarm and reads. “Collision?” Suddenly out of the haze a mutli\\r\\n            fingered metal arm swoops in and grasps the ship. A loud crunching sound comes from the top. “Dani get your goddamn helmet\\r\\n            back on!” Walter yells into the back. He glances back seeing Dani reaching for her helmet, when the ship lurches. He’s slammed\\r\\n            into the floor and almost knocked out.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Sparks start to shoot out of every panel in the cockpit. Walter pulls himself toward the main panel, hits the emergency\\r\\n            button and pulls the main breaker. The sparks cease, but it wasn’t soon enough to prevent all hatches and locks from opening.\\r\\n            He grips the bottom of the pilot’s seat to prevent himself being pulled into space.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             After the whoosh of air, followed by silence broken only by his breathing, he looks into the back. Just then a light shines\\r\\n            into the high visibility cockpit. He frantically pulls himself out of view. He looks around to see Dani still typing away.\\r\\n            Her helmet looks like it was barely on, but she managed not to be pulled out the back when the bay opened up. Walters eye’s\\r\\n            were still adjusting to the light, but he has a feeling that Bullard was no longer on the ship. He was in his spacesuit,\\r\\n            a lot better one than Walter had, and he had space combat training. He will be alright.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Walter pulls himself over to Dani and tries to avoid being seen. They had no place to hide. He puts a hand on Dani’s shoulder.\\r\\n            She was typing. He could hear the typing sound resonate through her suit into his. She doesn’t respond.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            \\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             “This is insane Dani. Is the story really more important than our lives.” He knows she can’t hear him and even if they were\\r\\n            in a nice quiet room it wouldn’t matter. She would ignore him, but now she turns. He can barely make out her frightened face.\\r\\n            He could see her hand on a long breaker arm. This was all her equipment connected to its own power source. Her features became\\r\\n            clearer in the semi darkness and Walter could see the fear, but also a resolve. His mouth drops open looking back at the\\r\\n            breaker.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Walter takes a deep breath pushing back the swelling wave of sorrow. This meant their deaths. He gathers all of his strength\\r\\n            and nods his head. He feels his hand being grasped by Dani. A sweet gesture, then he realizes she’s pulling his hand up to\\r\\n            the breaker. Together they pull.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             The back of the ship springs to alive. Life unlike that of a human ship. There were organic tentacles pulsating with energy\\r\\n            reaching to the top of the ship. One tentacle has a wire harness at the end and jabs itself into the array’s maintenance\\r\\n            port. Now the ship is alive as well, powered by it’s distant organic cousin.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Dani was sending it all, unedited, no touch up, no makeup. He had no idea she was this brave. He looks at the transmission\\r\\n              and see the first sentence, short and to the point. We Are At War. He feels a lump in his throat.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             The ship moves wildly to port. Walter and Dani are thrown against the opposite bulkhead. He grabs onto Dani holding tight.\\r\\n            They bounce into a cargo net that popped out of its cargo container and fall halfway out of the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Walter sees streaks of light cutting through the ship. The cargo net comes loose and they float away from the ship, helpless,\\r\\n            watching the ship get torn apart by the giant Vanduul fang of a ship. The light goes out in the back and the transmission\\r\\n            array floats off in pieces.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             He feels Dani grip his arm. He looks at her, then notices she’s pointing. She was yelling something, he hears her muffled\\r\\n            voice through her hands gripping his suit. Was she panicking? No she was asking something. Where?\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Walter looks at their dead ship and toward the back he follows a cord that hangs limp in space connected to nothing.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             A spotlight shines on them. They see it closing, For a moment Walter thinks they are firing at them, but the rounds\\r\\n            were coming from the wrong angle. A bright flash, and explosion, debris hitting them rattling against their spacesuits.\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             The Vanduul ship flies away. Walter follows its progress then notices a pursuer. Too small to be a ship, it was one of their\\r\\n            drones. Walter laughs out a tear. “Go you little bastard, someone is going to find the best combat footage ever!”\\r\\n\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"indent\\\">\\r\\n             Walter could tell it was hard to breath. The suit was starting to constrict against his body, it was cold, very cold. Dani’s\\r\\n            grip on his arm was growing soft. He looks again for his drone. He finds it, still chasing the Vanduul ship. But there was\\r\\n            something else.
